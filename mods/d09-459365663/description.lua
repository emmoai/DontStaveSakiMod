Wortox is a demon - just like Krampus is, but way higher in ranks. He was always a better student than him,
after all it's Wortox who brilliantly created a nickname "Crappus". Now he came to this world do divide and
conquer with the power of his wonderful smile... right?

Wortox is friend to all evil, which basically means he will not be attacked unless provoked by mobs that are aggresive by default, including:
[img=http://imgur.com/Mss9iax.png] Spiders;
[img=http://imgur.com/dzhD8Ux.png] Werepigs;

He will always get attacked by bosses. 
Friend of all evil! is not only focused on monsters. All of the sanity values are inverted for Wortox. Whatever raises sanity for normal players - picking up flowers, eating crockpot recipies etc. - now removes sanity from Wortox. However everything that has a harmful effect on normal players' sanity gets inverted as well - and doubled!
 
Wortox can build structures called Wortelisks. They can be found in Magic Tab.

Wortelisk when placed changes everything in certain radius to it's evil counterparts - Bees turn into Killer Bees, Pigs into Werepigs, Trees into Totally Normal Trees, Flowers into Evil Flowers, Rabbits into Spiders etc. Be careful where you place it, as what helps Wortox doesn't help any other character!

Wortox is friend to all that's evil and an enemy to all that's good. If it doesn't speak for itself here is the explanation:
Every passive monster like:
[img=http://imgur.com/AetWMYW.png] Pigs;
[img=http://imgur.com/2n6SGDH.png] Bees;
[img=http://imgur.com/3SRZtxC.png] Beefalos;
Will automatically attack Wortox.
