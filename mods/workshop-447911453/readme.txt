Craftable Hollow Stump
A mod for Don't Starve Together
by blahpers

This mod allows you to craft a hollow stump using the Science machine.
The default recipe calls for logs, rope, and fish.
If you find the recipe a little too easy (or hard?),
the configuration options allow increasing or decreasing the amounts,
including adding beefalo wool and/or grass requirements.

Inspired by Ghost9610's Craftable Catcoon House mod for Don't Starve,
but rewritten from scratch as my first exercise in DST modding
and to avoid including the catcoon respawning tweaks from that mod.

Known issues:
  - If you enable more than five kinds of ingredient, the recipe tab icons
    can expand past the borders of the frame.  This is fairly typical of
	recipe mods.  The actual crafting process still works fine.

Acknowledgments:
  - Ghost9610 for the DS mod (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=245640159), which I liked enough to take my own crack at it.
  - Tullaphat for having the simplest example I could find of a recipe mod (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429396134)
  - TheSuns for an example of how to do buildable placers (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&id=396747046)
  - The various posters in this thread (http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/50798-how-do-i-build-a-custom-buildable-using-a-placer/) and its links.

Cheers,
